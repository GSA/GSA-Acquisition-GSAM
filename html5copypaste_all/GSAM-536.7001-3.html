               <p class="GSAM"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span>&nbsp;Contracting
officers shall acquire art in architecture services by negotiation,
and select sources in accordance with <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="GSAM-536.7003.html#GSAM_536-7003">536.7003</a>.</p>
            
            
               <p class="GSAM"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>&nbsp;To the extent
practicable, contracting officers should consider the GSA National
Artists Registry to conduct market research but may use alternative
sources or a combination of these methods.</p>
            
            
               <p class="GSAM"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>&nbsp;The advisory multi-step
process described in FAR <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/15.202" target="_blank">15.202</a> may be adapted for use with
acquisitions under this subpart. In an advisory process, potential
offerors submit information pre-solicitation that allows the Government
to advise them about their potential to be viable competitors. No
respondent is precluded from competing under an advisory process,
but it may and often does result in a more focused and effective
competition with long-shot respondents opting out.</p>
            
            
               <p class="GSAM"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span>&nbsp;A phased evaluation
may be adapted for use with acquisitions under this subpart. In
a phased evaluation, many offers are evaluated in the first phase
under first round evaluation criteria. Fewer offers are considered
in one or more subsequent phases on additional pre-specified evaluation
criteria. While an initial phase evaluation decision is not a competitive
range decision, it does eliminate proposals from the competition,
so a pre-award notice to unsuccessful offerors is required. If a
proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable, price does
not need to be considered. Price must be considered for phases where
an offer is eliminated from competition based on a tradeoff approach
and prior to award.</p>
            
            
               <p class="GSAM"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span>&nbsp;All art in architecture
contracts shall be fixed-priced contracts only, Final concept design
and fabrication shall be fixed price. Unless otherwise justified
in writing, all installation of artwork shall be fixed price.</p>
            
            
               <p class="GSAM"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span>&nbsp;Artwork may be
fabricated and installed through the construction contract for the
project if the construction contractor will contribute significantly
to the successful completion of the artwork.</p>
            
            
               <p class="GSAM"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span>&nbsp;The total price
of the artwork must be consistent with the GSA Art in Architecture
(AiA) Policies and Procedures Guide at <a class="xref" href="https://gsa.gov/artinarchitecture" target="_blank">https://gsa.gov/artinarchitecture</a>.</p>
