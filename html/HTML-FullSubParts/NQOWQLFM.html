         <p class="GSAR     ">“Preparedness” means actions that may include,
but are not limited to planning, resourcing, training, exercising,
and organizing to build, sustain, and improve operational disaster
response capabilities. Preparedness also includes the process of
identifying the personnel, training, and equipment needed for a
wide range of potential incidents, and developing jurisdiction-specific plans
for delivering capabilities when needed for an incident.</p>
         <p class="GSAR     ">“Recovery” means actions including, but not
limited to, the development, coordination, and execution of service-
and site-restoration plans; the reconstitution of Government operations

programs to provide housing and to promote restoration; long-term
care and treatment of affected persons; additional measures for
social, political, environmental, and economic restoration; evaluation

contracts containing Schedule 70 SINs, will apply.</p>

or instrumentality of the preceding entities (including any local
educational agency or institution of higher education), and including
