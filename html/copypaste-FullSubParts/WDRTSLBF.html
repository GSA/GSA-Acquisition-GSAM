						            HCAs are directed to take appropriate steps to ensure that physically completed contracts are formally closed in accordance with the procedures at FAR 4.804, GSAM <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#CTINUEOO">504.804-5</a>, and guidelines provided below for simplified acquisitions and contracts with residual balances. HCAs are reminded that when closing out contract actions at FAR 4.804-1(a)(2), (3), and (4), the contracting officer shall use the closeout procedures at FAR 4.804-5. However, these closeout actions may be modified to reflect the extent of administration that has been performed. Contracting activities that have supplemented the FAR procedures with instructions pertinent to the specific contract types, business systems, and resources employed are encouraged to continue the use of such supplements.</p>

						            &nbsp;Contracting officers must be vigilant and proactive with respect to proper contract closeout procedures.
