                  <em class="ph i">Small business consideration</em>. Solicitations that are not set-aside for small business concerns should consider inclusion of a small business participation evaluation factor (see FAR <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/15.304" target="_blank">15.304</a>(c)(4)) for additional requirements for procurements involving consolidation or bundling). The small business participation evaluation factor is separate from the small business subcontracting plan required at the contract level under FAR <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-19.7" target="_blank">19.7</a>. Differences between the subcontracting plan and the evaluation factor include:</p>

                        <span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>Small business subcontracting plan. Established at the contract level only for offerors that are other than small businesses. Prior compliance by the offeror with subcontracting plans under separate contracts will be considered by the contracting officer in determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of the contract, as required by FAR <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.705-5" target="_blank">19.705-5</a>. Contracting officers are required to review the plan to ensure it meets the requirements of FAR <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.704" target="_blank">19.704</a>. No award can be made to an offeror with an unacceptable subcontracting plan per FAR <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/19.702" target="_blank">19.702</a>(a)..</p>
