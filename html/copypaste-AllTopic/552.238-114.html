the Contractor accepts an order from such an entity, a separate
contract is formed which incorporates by reference all the terms
and conditions of the Schedule contract except the Disputes clause,
the patent indemnity clause, and the portion of the Commercial Products and Commercial
Services Contract Terms and Conditions that specifies “Compliance
with laws unique to Government contracts” (which applies only to
contracts with entities of the Executive branch of the U.S. Government).
The parties to this new contract which incorporates the terms and
conditions of the Schedule contract are the individual ordering
activity and the Contractor. The U.S. Government shall not be liable
for the performance or nonperformance of the new contract. Disputes
which cannot be resolved by the parties to the new contract may
be litigated in any State or Federal court with jurisdiction over
the parties, applying Federal procurement law, including statutes,
regulations and case law, and, if pertinent, the Uniform Commercial
Code. To the extent authorized by law, parties to this new contract
are encouraged to resolve disputes through Alternative Dispute Resolution. Likewise,
a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), although not a contract, is
an agreement that may be entered into by the Contractor with such
an entity and the Federal Government is not a party.</p>

with the terms and conditions of the Schedule contract. The ordering
activity and the Contractor expressly acknowledge that, in entering
into an agreement for the ordering activity to purchase goods or
