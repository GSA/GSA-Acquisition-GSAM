in architecture evaluation board members should collectively have
distinct expertise relevant to the project, including knowledge
of artwork and its long term care, the architect-engineer design
philosophy for the project, the programmatic and functional needs
of the Federal client, and the character of the community in which
the project is located.</p>

must sign a “Conflict of Interest Acknowledgement and Nondisclosure
Agreement” (Figure 515.3-1) before the activities of the board commence.
No person may serve as a board member if that person or any member of
that person’s family has any direct financial or employment interest
in any of the artists being evaluated. The board member is responsible
for identifying any possible conflict of interest once the competing
artists have been identified. If a conflict of interest is identified,
the contracting officer shall determine whether to disqualify that
member from the board.</p>
