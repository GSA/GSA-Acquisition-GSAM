at the time funds' are accepted (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, in the case of a DoD

Contracting officers must review all IA obligations for goods or
services that have been ordered but not yet received (undelivered
orders/unfilled customer orders) at fiscal year-end. Generally speaking,
if the IA is for goods or services that were not delivered within
the funds period of availability, the funds must be deobligated
and current funds used, unless the goods could not be delivered
because of delivery, production or manufacturing lead time, or unforeseen
delays that are out of the control and not previously contemplated
by the contracting parties at the time of contracting.
