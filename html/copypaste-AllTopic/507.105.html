                        <em class="ph i">Sustainable Acquisition Considerations</em>.
Whether it is in the requirements, the statement of work, the method
of award, or the contract administration strategy, most acquisitions
present opportunities to consider the impact on the environment.
For all acquisitions that require a written acquisition plan, environmental
impact shall be considered and documented in the acquisition plan
(see FAR <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-7#FAR_7_105" target="_blank">7.105</a>(b)(17)). When
addressing FAR <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-7#FAR_7_105" target="_blank">7.105</a>(b)(17) in the
acquisition plan, the contracting officer should address the following:</p>

                              <em class="ph i">Statement
of Work</em>. When conducting acquisition planning, the contracting
officer is encouraged to strategize with the program manager to
consider the most environmentally preferable solutions for the Government.
For example, this could include buying items with less packaging,
greater recycled content, longer shelf life, lower carbon footprint,
improved energy efficiency, less waste, or services that are performed
remotely to reduce the federal carbon footprint (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="511.002.html#GSAM_511_002">511.002</a>(a)
