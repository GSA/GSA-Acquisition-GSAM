            <em class="ph i">Oral acquisition plans</em>. Oral acquisition plans
are only authorized by approval of the HCA and may be used in unusual
and compelling situations. The planner shall document a summary
of the oral acquisition plan, and shall also include: the name and signature
of the approving official; the date the oral acquisition plan was
approved; and the reason for waiving a written acquisition plan.
The summary shall be included in the official contract file. In
addition, the summary should be a part of, or attached to, any justification
for other than full and open competition as required by FAR 6.302,
or in the basis for using an exception to the fair opportunity process
required by FAR 16.505(b)(2). The summary may be prepared after
award if preparation before award would unreasonably delay the award,
such as in the case of circumstances warranting the use of a letter
contract.</p>
