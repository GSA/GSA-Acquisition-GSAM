The Federal Acquisition Certification for Program and Project Managers
(FAC-P/PM) core certification program certifies program and project
managers at three levels: Entry, Mid and Senior. This certification
program is based upon a competency model of performance outcomes
which measures the knowledge, skills and abilities gained by program and
project managers through professional training, job experience and
continuous learning. Program and Project Managers (P/PMs) are critical
to project success, including developing accurate government requirements
and managing life-cycle activities to ensure that intended outcomes
are achieved. Information about FAC-P/PM is available at <a class="xref" href="https://www.fai.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.fai.gov/ </a>and
GSA’s Acquisition Portal at <a class="xref" href="https://insite.gsa.gov/acquisitionportal" target="_blank">https://insite.gsa.gov/acquisitionportal</a>.</p>
