officer calculates the applicable threshold, consider the actual
or estimated value of the contract for the entire term of the contract,
including any option period(s). This also applies to schedule contracts
and other indefinite delivery type contracts. Consider the estimated
value of all orders expected to be placed during the term plus all options.</p>

19.705-2(d) permits the contracting officer to require submission
of subcontracting plans with initial offers under a negotiated acquisition.
The contracting officer <u class="ph u">must</u> require all offerors (other
than small business concerns) to submit subcontracting plans with
their initial offers when a negotiated acquisition meets all conditions:</p>

in paragraph (b) above limits the contracting officer’s ability

for multiple award schedules where GSA may have responsibility for
negotiating commercial plans.</p>
