                  <span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span>&nbsp;<em class="ph i">General.</em> GSA is generally not authorized to award personal service contracts. Personal services contracts are often triggered by perception, in particular when it is hard to differentiate between contractor employees and Federal employees. GSA contracting activities should avoid engaging in personal services contracts as described in <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/37.104" target="_blank">FAR&nbsp;37.104</a>, unless excepted (see paragraph (b)), and work to establish and administer contracts such that the risk of the appearance of personal service contracts is mitigated and documented in the file. For more information on how to administer service contracts and avoid inappropriate personal service contract perception, see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="537.504.html#GSAM_537_504">537.504</a>.</p>
