                        <span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> &nbsp;Authorized personnel mark the envelope (or other covering) of each package identified as a bid or modification with a time-stamp or the place, date, and time of receipt.

At least once daily and immediately preceding the time scheduled for bid opening, the bid custodian removes and time stamps the bids. If a bidder hands a bid to the bid custodian or other GSA employee, the custodian or employee time stamps the bid immediately.</p>

The bid opening official or designee acknowledges receipt of the bids by signing the copy of the form and returning it to the bid custodian.
