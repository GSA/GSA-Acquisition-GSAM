acquisition is not exempt under FAR 5.202 or GSAR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#GSAM_570_106">570.106</a>(e),
and is for a leasehold interest in real property estimated to exceed
10,000 square feet, then the contracting officer must publicize

not subject to a square foot measurement (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, antennas,

acquisition in the GPE when the contract action is expected to exceed
$25,000, unless an exception under FAR 5.202 applies.</p>

in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, the contracting officer
need not publicize the proposed acquisition of a leasehold interest
in real property, including expansion requests within the scope
of a lease (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="570.403.html#GSAM_570_403">570.403</a>), lease extensions
under the conditions defined in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="570.405.html#GSAM_570_405">570.405</a>,

However, the contracting officer may publicize proposed lease acquisitions
of any dollar value or square footage in the GPE or local newspapers
if, in the opinion of the contracting officer, doing so is necessary
to promote competition.</p>
