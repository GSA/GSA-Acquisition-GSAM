                  <span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Discounts
for early payment (hereinafter referred to as “discounts” or “the
discount”) will be considered in evaluating the relationship of
the Offeror's concessions to the Government vis-a-vis the Offeror's
concessions to its commercial and Federal non-schedule customers,
but only to the extent indicated in this clause.</p>

solicitation.</p>
				        
				        
					          <p class="GSAR ListL1">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Uneconomical discounts
will not be considered as meeting the criteria for award established
by the Government. In this connection, a discount will be considered
uneconomical if the annualized rate of return for earning the discount
is lower than the “value of funds” rate established by the Department
of the Treasury and published quarterly in the Federal Register.
The “value of funds” rate applied will be the rate in effect on
the date specified for the receipt of offers.</p>

early payment may be offered either in the original offer or on
individual invoices submitted under the resulting contract. Discounts
offered will be taken by the ordering activity if payment is made
within the discount period specified.</p>

are included in offers become a part of the resulting contracts

contract. Discounts offered only on individual invoices will be
binding on the Contractor only for the particular invoice on which
the discount is offered.</p>

with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed

earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date
which appears on the payment check or the date on which an electronic
funds transfer was made.</p>
