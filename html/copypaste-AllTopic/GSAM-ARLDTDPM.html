Whether it is in the requirements, the statement of work, the method of award, or the contract administration strategy, most acquisitions present opportunities to consider the impact on the environment. For all acquisitions that require a written acquisition plan, environmental impact shall be considered and documented in the acquisition plan (see FAR <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-7#FAR_7_105" target="_blank">7.105</a>(b)(17)). When addressing FAR <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-7#FAR_7_105" target="_blank">7.105</a>(b)(17) in the acquisition plan, the contracting officer should address the following:</span>

When conducting acquisition planning, the contracting officer is encouraged to strategize with the program manager to consider the most environmentally preferable solutions for the Government. For example, this could include buying items with less packaging, greater recycled content, longer shelf life, lower carbon footprint, improved energy efficiency, less waste, or services that are performed remotely to reduce the federal carbon footprint (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="GSAM-i1890257.html#i1890257">511.002</a>(a) for additional guidance).</span>
