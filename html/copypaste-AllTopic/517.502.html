                         &nbsp;Where there is a conflict between the requesting agency and GSA policy, refer to the interagency agreement to resolve the conflict.

							              <p class=" ListL2">

                         &nbsp;When the requesting agency’s policy is less restrictive than GSA’s policy (e.g., higher dollar authority, streamlined procedures) and the interagency agreement does not identify which policy to follow, the contracting officer has discretion on which policy to follow. However, the contracting officer must consult with Service-level acquisition management (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, FAS OPC, PBS OAM) and OGC if following the less restrictive policy to ensure GSA has adequate controls in place and has the authority to utilize the less restrictive policy. </p>
						            
						            

						               <p class=" ListL2">

                        A number of agencies have authorities which GSA does not have. GSA cannot use a requesting agency’s given program authority (e.g., Other Transaction Authority (OTA)) unless the authority is specifically delegated to GSA by the requesting agency in a formal delegation.</p>
