Reasons for any report rejections must be recorded in eSRS to prevent recurring errors. Contracting officers must ensure contractors submit revised reports within 30 days of rejection as required by FAR <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/52.219-9" target="_blank">52.219-9</a>(l).
