Examples of programs that facilitate requisitions from customer agencies include GSA stock supply programs and GSA motor vehicle purchasing. Customer agencies submit requisitions (sometimes referred to as “orders”) to GSA for items under these programs in accordance with the FPMR. GSA then acquires these items from suppliers through contracts or orders in accordance with the FAR and GSAM.</p>

Under this model, common administrative services-those activities that are common across all agencies-are conducted by an agency (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em> shared service provider) with expertise in a particular area to reduce duplication and redundancy. In turn, the customer agency reimburses the shared service provider for its costs. Often, shared service providers must conduct acquisitions in order to provide services to other agencies. Accordingly, only the contract/order awarded by the shared service provider to a contractor is reported in FPDS.</p>
