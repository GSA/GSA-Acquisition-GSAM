Personal services contracts are often triggered by perception, in

in personal services contracts as described in FAR Subpart 37.104, unless
excepted (see paragraph (b)), and work to establish and administer
contracts such that the risk of the appearance of personal service
contracts is mitigated and documented in the file. For more information

								                <span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>&nbsp;Identification. Have contractor

							              <p class="GSAM" id="GSAM_537_504__id216GF0V03E9"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

								                <span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span>&nbsp;Clear terms and conditions.
Clearly define performance roles, expectations, and deliverables

specify that the contractor supervise their staff onsite when feasible.</p>

price (FFP) contract type is preferable for work performed that
could have the appearance of personal services, since other contract
types require more Government oversight which could lead to the
appearance of personal services; however all contract types are

Contractor assignments should be communicated by the contracting
officer, or COR, directly to one representative for the contractor
(such as a contractor's team lead or program manager).</p>

Avoid ad hoc work assignments which can create a personal services
relationship, and may also cause "scope creep" to the contract,
which places the Government at risk of a future claim.</p>
