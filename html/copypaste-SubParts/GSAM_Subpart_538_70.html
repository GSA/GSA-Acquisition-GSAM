			      <p class="GSAR     ">“Ordering activity” (also called “ordering
agency” and “ordering office”) means an eligible ordering activity (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="GSAM_Subpart_552_2.html#GSAM_552_238_112">552.238-112</a>) authorized
to place orders under Federal Supply Schedule contracts.</p>
			      <p class="GSAR     ">“Preparedness” means actions that may include,
but are not limited to planning, resourcing, training, exercising,
and organizing to build, sustain, and improve operational disaster
response capabilities. Preparedness also includes the process of
identifying the personnel, training, and equipment needed for a
wide range of potential incidents, and developing jurisdiction-specific plans
for delivering capabilities when needed for an incident.</p>
			      <p class="GSAR     ">“Recovery” means actions including, but not
limited to, the development, coordination, and execution of service-
and site-restoration plans; the reconstitution of Government operations
and services; individual, private-sector, nongovernmental, and public-assistance
programs to provide housing and to promote restoration; long-term
care and treatment of affected persons; additional measures for
social, political, environmental, and economic restoration; evaluation
of the incident to identify lessons learned; post-incident reporting;
and development of initiatives to mitigate the effects of future
incidents.</p>
			      <p class="GSAR     ">“Relief” means disaster “response” and “recovery.”

Response also includes the execution of emergency plans and actions

			      <p class="GSAR     ">“Schedule 70,” as used in this subpart, means
Schedule 70 information technology contracts, and Consolidated Products
and Services Schedule contracts containing information technology
SINs. The Consolidated Products and Services Schedule is a compilation
of multiple individual Federal Supply Schedules; therefore, only
the SINs that fall under Schedule 70 of the Consolidated Products
and Services Schedule will apply to Cooperative Purchasing. No other
Schedules, or SINs, containing information technology outside of
Schedule 70 SINs, and Consolidated Products and Services Schedule
contracts containing Schedule 70 SINs, will apply.</p>
			      <p class="GSAR     ">“Schedule 84” means the Federal Supply Schedule
for alarm and signal systems, facility management systems, firefighting and
rescue equipment, law enforcement and security equipment, marine
craft and related equipment, special purpose clothing, and related

group).</p>
			      <p class="GSAR     ">“State and local government entities,” as used
in this subpart, means the states of the United States, counties,
municipalities, cities, towns, townships, tribal governments, public

other institutions of higher education, council of governments (incorporated
or not), regional or interstate government entities, or any agency
or instrumentality of the preceding entities (including any local
educational agency or institution of higher education), and including
legislative and judicial departments. The term does not include
contractors of, or grantees of, State or local governments.</p>
