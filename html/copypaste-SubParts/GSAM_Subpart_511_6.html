purpose of the DPAS is to assure the timely availability of industrial
resources to meet current national defense, energy, and civil emergency
preparedness program requirements and to provide an operating system
to support rapid industrial response in a national emergency. The
primary statutory authority for the DPAS is Title I of the Defense
Production Act of 1950, as amended, with additional authority from
the Selective Service Act of 1948 and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster
Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Executive Orders 12919 and
12742 delegate to the DOC authority to administer the DPAS. Within
the DOC, the Office of Strategic Industries and Economic Security
(SIES) is assigned responsibility for DPAS implementation, administration,
and compliance.</p>

other implementing guidance, including information on special priorities

DPAS are “rated orders.” Rated orders must receive preferential
treatment only as necessary to meet delivery requirements. Rated
orders are identified by a rating symbol of either “DX” or “DO”
followed by a program identification symbol. All “DO” rated orders
have equal priority with each other and take preference over unrated
orders. All “DX” rated orders have equal priority with each other
and take preference over “DO” rated orders and unrated orders. A
program identification symbol indicates which approved program is
supported by the rated order.</p>

                  <span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> A DPAS rating may be placed against an entire contract at time of award or an individual order issued under an existing, otherwise unrated, contract. FAR 11.604 requires contracting officers to insert the provision at 52.211-14, Notice of Priority Rating for National Defense, Emergency Preparedness, and Energy Program Use, in solicitations when the contract or order to be awarded will be a rated order and to insert the clause at 52.211-15, Defense Priority and Allocation Requirements, in contracts that are rated orders.</p>

                  <span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> In addition to the FAR provision and clause referenced in paragraph (a) of this section, the contract or order must include the following (see 15 CFR 700.12):</p>

                        <span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> &nbsp;The appropriate priority rating symbol (i.e., either “DO” or “DX”) along with the program identification symbol. When GSA contracting officers place DO rated orders, they must use program identification symbol “K1”. When placing a DX-rated order for other agencies, GSA contracting officers must use the requesting agency program identification symbol from the DoD Master Urgency List and may only do so when GSA is acting as the procuring agent for DoD or DoE and has received a “DX” rated contract or order from either department.</p>
