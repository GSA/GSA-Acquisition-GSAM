or otherwise responding to the contractor’s allegations in a formal
pleading called the Answer. The contracting officer shall assist
designated litigation counsel in the drafting of the Answer by advising
whether the contractor’s allegations of fact should be admitted
or denied. If a response to an allegation in the complaint requires
information in the possession of other GSA personnel, the contracting
officer shall conduct sufficient research reasonably necessary in
order to form a belief as to the truth of the allegation. If the
information necessary to form a belief as to the truth of the allegation
is not in GSA’s possession, the contracting officer shall so advise
designated litigation counsel. In some cases, the Government may
respond to the Complaint by filing a motion to dismiss in lieu of
filing an Answer. Designated litigation counsel will advise the contracting
officer if a motion to dismiss will be filed.</p>
