			      <p class="GSAR     ">“CMc Contingency Allowance (CCA)” means an allowance for the
exclusive use of the construction contractor to cover reimbursable
costs during construction that are not the basis of a change order.
These costs could include estimating, scheduling, and planning errors
in the final Estimated Cost of the Work (ECW) or other contractor
errors.</p>
			      <p class="GSAR     ">“Cost” means allowable costs in accordance with FAR Part 31.</p>

work and fee for the construction work.</p>
			      <p class="GSAR     ">“Early Work Package” means a set of construction activities that
can be clearly defined and separately performed from the remainder
of the construction work. Demolition is an example of an early work
package.</p>
			      <p class="GSAR     ">“Estimated Cost of the Work (ECW)” means the estimated cost of
the construction work, not including home office overhead.</p>

in the construction contract for the contractor's profit and home
office overhead costs, as described in FAR part 31, for the construction
work.</p>

evaluating the construction contractor's proposal for firm-fixed-price
definitization, the contracting officer should compare the anticipated
final cost to the firm-fixed-price being proposed. It may be reasonable
for the construction contractor to include a contingency for assuming
the risk associated with agreeing to the firm-fixed-price. The contracting officer
should evaluate this contingency to ensure that the proposed amount
reasonably reflects the remaining risks being assumed by the construction
contractor. This evaluation may be informed by the history of the
project, the balance of the CCA, and other factors.</p>
