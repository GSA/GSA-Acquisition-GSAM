fine art should be incorporated in the designs of Federal buildings,

process described in FAR <a class="xref" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/15.202" target="_blank">15.202</a> may be adapted for use with
acquisitions under this subpart. In an advisory process, potential
offerors submit information pre-solicitation that allows the Government
to advise them about their potential to be viable competitors. No
respondent is precluded from competing under an advisory process,
but it may and often does result in a more focused and effective
competition with long-shot respondents opting out.</p>

may be adapted for use with acquisitions under this subpart. In
a phased evaluation, many offers are evaluated in the first phase
under first round evaluation criteria. Fewer offers are considered
in one or more subsequent phases on additional pre-specified evaluation
criteria. While an initial phase evaluation decision is not a competitive
range decision, it does eliminate proposals from the competition,
so a pre-award notice to unsuccessful offerors is required. If a
proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable, price does
not need to be considered. Price must be considered for phases where
an offer is eliminated from competition based on a tradeoff approach
and prior to award.</p>
