a negotiated acquisition, if the contracting officer believes that
the acquisition provides substantial subcontracting opportunities,
consider including the offeror’s subcontracting plan as an evaluation
factor for award. This may be most appropriate in acquisitions when
the contracting officer expects individual plans or master plans.
The contracting officer should consult with his or her SBTA or regional
SBUC to obtain any needed assistance with developing subcontracting
plan evaluation criteria before incorporating the plan into the
solicitation as an evaluation factor.</p>

establishing target goals for sealed bid solicitations, the contracting
officer should avoid using mechanical formulas or similar approaches
that may be considered arbitrary. Reviewing historical performance
by contractors performing similar work is valid, but the contracting
officer should consider each solicitation independently in terms
of the potential for subcontracting. Use as many information sources
as practical, including the contracting officer’s own knowledge
of the supplies or services. Factors to consider in setting targets
