This merits a risk evaluation below the range that would otherwise apply for the contract type proposed.

you sell to the customer or category of customer identified in column
1, without regard to quantity; terms and conditions of the agreements
under which the discounts are given; and whether the agreements
are written or oral. Net prices or discounts off of other price
lists should be expressed as percentage discounts from the price
list which is the basis of your offer. If the discount disclosed
is a combination of various discounts (prompt payment, quantity,
etc.), the percentage should be broken out for each type of discount.
If the price lists which are the basis of the discounts given to
the customers identified in the chart are different than the price
list submitted upon which your offer is based, identify the type

require submission of these price lists. To expedite evaluation,
