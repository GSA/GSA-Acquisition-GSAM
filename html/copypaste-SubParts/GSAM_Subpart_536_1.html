			      <p class="p">“Construction activity” means the organizational level
of the agency that has authority and responsibility for the architectural, engineering,
and other technical or administrative aspects of design and construction.</p>
			      <p class="p GSAR">“Construction-Manager-as-Constructor”
(CMc) means the project delivery method where design and construction
are contracted concurrently through two separate contracts and two
separate contractors. Unlike the traditional design-bid-build delivery method,
under the CMc delivery method, the Government awards a separate
contract to a designer <em class="ph i">(i.e.</em>, architect-engineer contractor)
and to a construction contractor (<em class="ph i">i.e.</em>, CMc contractor) prior
to the completion of the design documents. The Government retains
the CMc contractor during design to work with the architect-engineer
contractor to provide constructability reviews and cost estimating
validation. The CMc contract includes design phase services at a
firm-fixed-price and an option for construction at a guaranteed
maximum price.</p>
			      <p class="p">“Statutory cost limitations” means the cost limits included in
the agency’s statutory authorization or annual appropriations act
(by law).</p>
