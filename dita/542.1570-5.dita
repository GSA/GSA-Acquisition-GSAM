         <p class="- topic/p ">The reviewing official must be a Government employee. The reviewing official provides the check-and-balance when there is disagreement between the assessing official and the contractor regarding the contractor performance evaluation (see FAR <xref scope="external"
                  format="html"
                  href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/42.1503"
                  class="- topic/xref ">42.1503</xref>(d)). The reviewing official is generally responsible for reviewing, providing comments (the reviewing officialâ€™s comments supplement those provided by the assessing official; they do not replace the ratings/narratives provided by the assessing official), and signing the contractor performance evaluation when a contractor indicates non-concurrence with a contractor performance evaluation. The ultimate conclusion on the contractor performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency.</p>
