and is for a leasehold interest in real property estimated to exceed
10,000 square feet, then the contracting officer must publicize

                   For leasehold acquisitions where
the solicitation requires the construction of a new building on
a preselected site, the contracting officer, in accordance with

acquisition in the GPE regardless

not subject to a square foot measurement (<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">e.g.</i>, antennas,

acquisition in the GPE when
the contract action is expected to exceed $25,000, unless an exception

in real property, including expansion requests within the scope
of a lease (see <xref href="GSAM-i1855144.dita#i1855144"

However, the contracting officer may publicize proposed lease acquisitions
of any dollar value or square footage in the GPE or local newspapers
if, in the opinion of the contracting officer, doing so is necessary
to promote competition.</p>
