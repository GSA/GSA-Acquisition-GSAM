May 1962, the <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture</i> report
emphasized that the design of new buildings should provide visual
testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the
American Government. The report also stated that where appropriate,
fine art should be incorporated in the designs of Federal buildings,
with emphasis on the work of living American artists.</p>

41 CFR Part 102-77 Art-In-Architecture was published requiring Federal
agencies to incorporate fine arts as an integral part of the total
building concept when designing new Federal buildings, and when
making substantial repairs and alterations to existing Federal buildings,
as appropriate.</p>
