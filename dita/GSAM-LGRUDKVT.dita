In the absence of the original contracting officer, another contracting officer with appropriate warrant authority may sign. Always type or stamp the name and title of the contracting officer signing the contract on the document, unless it is electronically signed. An electronic contract which includes the name of the contracting officer satisfies the typed, stamped or printed requirement found in FAR 4.101.
