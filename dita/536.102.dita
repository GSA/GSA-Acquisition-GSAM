of the agency that has authority and responsibility for the architectural, engineering,
and other technical or administrative aspects of design and construction.</p>
         <p audience="GSAR" class="- topic/p ">“Construction-Manager-as-Constructor”
(CMc) means the project delivery method where design and construction
are contracted concurrently through two separate contracts and two
separate contractors. Unlike the traditional design-bid-build delivery method,
under the CMc delivery method, the Government awards a separate
contract to a designer <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">(i.e.</i>, architect-engineer contractor)
and to a construction contractor (<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">i.e.</i>, CMc contractor) prior
to the completion of the design documents. The Government retains
the CMc contractor during design to work with the architect-engineer
contractor to provide constructability reviews and cost estimating
validation. The CMc contract includes design phase services at a
firm-fixed-price and an option for construction at a guaranteed
maximum price.</p>

the agency’s statutory authorization or annual appropriations act
