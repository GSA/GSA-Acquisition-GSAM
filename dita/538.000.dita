                   This part prescribes policies and procedures for contracting for supplies and services under the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program. GSA may delegate certain responsibilities for other agency acquisition programs as they relate to the establishment of individual federal supply schedules. </p>

               <p rev="Change 174 February 12, 2024"><ph props="autonumber" class="- topic/ph ">(b)</ph> The authority of other agencies to award FSS contracts can only be accomplished through delegation from GSA. An agency delegated authority by GSA to award contracts under the FSS program is responsible for complying with GSA regulations and policies that apply to the FSS program, unless an exception is approved by GSA (see 538.001). </p>
