to occupy the space in partial increments prior to the substantial
completion of the entire leased premises, and the Lessor agrees
to schedule its work so as to deliver the space incrementally as
elected by the Government. The Government shall pay rent commencing
with the first business day following substantial completion of
the entire leased premise unless the Government has elected to occupy
the leased premises incrementally. In case of incremental occupancy,
the Government shall pay rent pro rata upon the first business day
following substantial completion of each incremental unit. Rental
payments shall become due on the first workday of the month following
the month in which an increment of space is substantially complete,
except that should an increment of space be substantially completed
after the fifteenth day of the month, the payment due date will
be the first workday of the second month following the month in
which it was substantially complete. The commencement date of the
firm lease term will be a composite determined from all rent commencement dates.</p>
