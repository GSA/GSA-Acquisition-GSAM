are requested to insert, in the spaces provided below or by attachment
hereto, a separate charge for “Delivery Within Consignee's Premises”
applicable to each shipping container to be shipped. (Articles which
are comparable in size and weight, and for which the same charge
is applicable, should be grouped under an appropriate item description.)
These additional charges will be accepted as part of the award,
if considered reasonable, and shall be included in the Contractor's published
catalog and/or price list.</p>

activities are not obligated to issue orders on the basis of “Delivery
Within Consignee's Premises,” and Contractors may refuse delivery
on that basis provided such refusal is communicated in writing to
the ordering activity issuing such orders within 5 days of the receipt
of such order by the Contractor and provided further, that delivery
is made in accordance with the other delivery requirements of the
contract. Failure of the Contractor to submit this notification
within the time specified shall constitute acceptance to furnish
“Delivery Within Consignee's Premises” at the additional charge awarded.
When an ordering activity issues an order on the basis of “Delivery
Within Consignee's Premises” at the accepted additional charge awarded
and the Contractor accepts such orders on that basis, the Contractor
will be obligated to provide delivery “F.o.b. Destination, Within
Consignee's Premises” in accordance with FAR 52.247-35, which is
then incorporated by reference, with the exception that an additional
charge as provided herein is allowed for such services. Unless otherwise stipulated
by the Offeror, the additional charges awarded hereunder may be
applied to any delivery within the 48 contiguous States and the
District of Columbia.</p>
