                   Except
as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, although CMc contracts
are considered incentive-type contracts (see <xref outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly"
                        class="- topic/xref "

officers are authorized to use the CMc project delivery method without
completing a determination and finding as required by <xref href="https://www.acquisition.gov/content/16401-general-table-16-1"
                        format="html"

                        class="- topic/xref ">FAR 16.401</xref>(d).
Contracting officers shall discuss the CMc project delivery method
as part of the acquisition plan (see <xref href="https://www.acquisition.gov/content/7105-contents-written-acquisition-plans"
                        format="html"

                   To
the extent the contracting officer incorporates an award-fee component
into the CMc (in addition to the shared savings incentive), then
the determination and finding required by <xref href="https://www.acquisition.gov/content/16401-general-table-16-1"
                        format="html"

                  <ph props="autonumber" class="- topic/ph ">(c)</ph>
                   The
contracting officer shall use the tradeoff process as described
in <xref href="https://www.acquisition.gov/content/15101-1-tradeoff-process"
                        format="html"

unless a different source selection approach is approved in writing
by the HCA, for selecting a construction contractor under the CMc
project delivery method, and select sources in accordance with subpart
536.7103.</p>
