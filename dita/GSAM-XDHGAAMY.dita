						            Once a contracting activity acquires a product or service successfully on the basis of a set-aside, the activity must acquire all future requirements for that product or service using set-aside procedures. If the contracting officer determines that he or she no longer can reasonably expect to receive offers from at least two responsible small business concerns and make awards at fair market prices, use the procedures in FAR 19.506 to withdraw or modify a set-aside. When market research reveals that any supplies or services from mandatory sources, such as Federal Prison Industries, Inc. and AbilityOne, that were not available at the time of the original requirement have become available, a contracting officer may discontinue setting aside a continuing requirement (see FAR 8.002 and 8.003). The contracting officer shall document the determination to discontinue setting aside a continuing requirement (see <xref outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly"
