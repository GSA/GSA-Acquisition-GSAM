of items is awarded to a Contractor other than the one receiving
the award on the corresponding non-set-aside portion, the Government
will divide the requirements to be ordered between the two Contractors
with the objective of achieving, as nearly as possible, a 50/50
division of the total value of orders placed after the award of
the set-aside portion. In no case will this division vary by more
than a 60/40 division (with either the non-set-aside or set-aside
Contractor receiving the larger portion) from the time of the award
of the set-aside portion.</p>
