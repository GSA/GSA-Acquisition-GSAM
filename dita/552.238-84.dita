by the Government. In this connection, a discount will be considered
uneconomical if the annualized rate of return for earning the discount
is lower than the “value of funds” rate established by the Department
of the Treasury and published quarterly in the Federal Register.
The “value of funds” rate applied will be the rate in effect on
the date specified for the receipt of offers.</p>
