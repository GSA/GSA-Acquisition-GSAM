Government may make multiple awards for the supplies or services
offered in response to this solicitation that meet the definition
of a “commercial item” in FAR 52.202 1. Awards may be made to those
responsible offerors that offer reasonable pricing, conforming to
the solicitation, and will be most advantageous to the Government,
taking into consideration the multiplicity and complexity of items
of various manufacturers and the differences in performance required
to accomplish or produce required end results, production and distribution
facilities, price, compliance with delivery requirements, and other
pertinent factors. By providing a selection of comparable supplies
or services, ordering activities are afforded the opportunity to
fulfill their requirements with the item(s) that constitute the
best value and that meet their needs at the lowest overall cost.</p>
