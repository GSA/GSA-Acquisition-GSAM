						             Contractors should be required to submit invoices or vouchers to the contracting officer. The date on which the contracting officer receives the invoice or voucher will be used to determine interest penalties for late payments. The contracting officer, or designee, must review the processing of invoices or vouchers before payment to determine if the items and amounts claimed are consistent with the contract terms and represent prudent business transactions. The contracting officer must ensure that these payments are commensurate with physical and technical progress under the contract. If the contractor has not deducted questionable amounts from the invoice or amounts required to be withheld, the contracting officer is responsible for making the required deduction, except as provided in <xref href="532.7203.dita#GSAM_532_7203"
