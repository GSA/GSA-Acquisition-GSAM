the Government fails to occupy any portion of the leased premises
or vacates the premises in whole or in part before the lease term
expires, the rental rate will be reduced. The reduction shall occur

the vacant premises or the lease expires or is terminated.</p>

not required to maintain the space. In addition, at the first operating
cost adjustment after the notice of reduction to the rent, the base
cost of services subject to escalation will be reduced by said amount.

of the vacant premises, the base cost of services subject to escalation
will be increased by said amount.</p>
