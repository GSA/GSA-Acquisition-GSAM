						            &nbsp;The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by determining the lowest base period price. When option year pricing is based on a formula (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>,changes in the Producer Price Index or other common standard), option year pricing is automatically considered when evaluating the base year price, as any change in price will be uniformly related to changes in market conditions. All options are therefore considered to be evaluated. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>

This rate is referred to as the “Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,” and it is published in the Federal Register semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the invoice principal payment amount approved by the Government until the payment date of such approved principal amount; and will be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through the payment date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the approved invoice principal payment amount and will be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period. If the designated billing office failed to notify the Contractor of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in paragraph <a class="xref fm:(alpha)(number)" href="#i1873543__i1873577">(a)(5)</a> of this clause, the due date on the corrected invoice will be adjusted by subtracting from such date the number of days taken beyond the prescribed notification of defects period.

of the reasonableness and realism of the project schedule, accurate
monitoring of progress, and reliable analysis of schedule impacts.</p>
         <p class="p Body_Alternate_List2">(3)
Activity durations shall be based upon reasonable and realistic
allocation of the resources required to complete each activity, given
physical and logistical constraints on the performance of the work.
All logic shall validly reflect physical or logistical constraints on
relationships between activities. Except for the first and last
activities in the project schedule, each activity shall have at
least one predecessor and one successor relationship to form a logically
connected network plan from notice to proceed to the contract completion
date.</p>

period for updates is specified elsewhere, the Contractor shall
update the project schedule monthly to reflect actual progress in
completing the work, and submit the updated project schedule within
5 working days of the end of each month.</p>

Offerors must include the IFF in their prices. The fee is included in the award price(s) and reflected in the total amount charged to ordering activities. FAS will post notice of the current IFF at <a class="xref" href="https://72a.gsa.gov/" target="_blank">https://72a.gsa.gov/</a> or successor website as appropriate.</p>

If the Contractor fails to submit the required transactional data reports, falsifies them, or fails to timely pay the IFF, these reasons constitute sufficient cause for the Government to terminate the contract for cause.</p>

A documented description of the inspection system shall be made available to the Government before contract award. At the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer, he/she may authorize in writing exceptions to the quality assurance standards identified above. The Contractor shall immediately notify the Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) of any changes made in the inspection system during the contract period. As used herein, the term “inspection system” means the Contractor’s own facility or any other facility acceptable to the Government that will be used to perform inspections or tests of materials and components before incorporation into end articles and for inspection of such end articles before shipment. When the manufacturing plant is located outside of the United States, the Contractor shall arrange delivery of the items from a plant or warehouse located in the United States (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) equipped to perform all inspections and tests required by the contract or specifications to evidence conformance therewith, or shall arrange with a testing laboratory or other facility in the United States, acceptable to the Government, to perform the required inspections and tests.</p>
